# NER22A Electrical Schematics
This repository contains the KiCAD electrical Schematic files and Altium schematic PDFs for the NER22A FSAE vehicle. 

## File Locations
All non-PCB electrical schematics are drawn in [**KiCAD 6**](https://www.kicad.org/download/).\
Schematic files for PCBs are drawn in Altium and can be found in the [NER Altium 365 Vault](https://northeastern-fsae.365.altium.com/getstarted). 
> Note: Once a PCB has been ordered, the schematics should be printed as a PDF and put in the relevant folder in this repository.
